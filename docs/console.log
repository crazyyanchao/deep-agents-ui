useChat.ts:58 BlockingError: Blocking call to os.access

Heads up! LangGraph dev identified a synchronous blocking call in your code. When running in an ASGI web server, blocking calls can degrade performance for everyone since they tie up the event loop.

Here are your options to fix this:

1. Best approach: Convert any blocking code to use async/await patterns
   For example, use 'await aiohttp.get()' instead of 'requests.get()'

2. Quick fix: Move blocking operations to a separate thread
   Example: 'await asyncio.to_thread(your_blocking_function)'

3. Override (if you can't change the code):
   - For development: Run 'langgraph dev --allow-blocking'
   - For deployment: Set 'BG_JOB_ISOLATED_LOOPS=true' environment variable

These blocking operations can prevent health checks and slow down other runs in your deployment. Following these recommendations will help keep your LangGraph application running smoothly!
